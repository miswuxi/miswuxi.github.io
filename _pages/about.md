Hi, I am Xi Wu, a fifth-year Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Management Information Systems at Temple Universityâ€™s Fox School of Business. 


My primary research interest is in the area of information economics. The core question that motivates my research is: *How do technologies influence the process by which firms capture and create values?*

In particular, my work tries to understand knowledge creation, innovation, and entrepreneurship in Information Technology (IT) industries. My current research focuses on **digital platforms**, **open-source software**, and **intellectual property in digital age**. My research uses interdisciplinary approaches such as econometrics, analytical modeling, and machine learning.


My work has been presented in leading conferences such as the Conference on Information Systems and Technology, the International Conference of Information Systems, the Academy of Management Annual Meeting, and the Strategic Management Society Conference.
