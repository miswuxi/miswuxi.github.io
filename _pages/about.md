Hi, I am Xi Wu, a fifth-year Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Management Information Systems at Temple Universityâ€™s Fox business school. My research interest is to understand how technologies influence the process by which firms capture and create values, with the research areas on (1) innovation and entrepreneurship, (2) digital platforms, and (3) intellectual property in the digital age.
My work has been presented in leading conferences such as the Conference on Information Systems and Technology, the International Conference of Information Systems, the Academy of Management Annual Meeting, and the Strategic Management Society Conference.
