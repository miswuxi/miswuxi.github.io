### How Data Privacy Regulations Affect Competition: Empirical Evidence from Mobile Application Market

<span style="font-size:0.9em;">**Abstract**: In the digital age, data has become a source of competitive advantages for businesses, resulting in firms’ extensive collection of personal data. This has sparked a debate over data privacy and security. Government regulators start establishing privacy regulations to ensure the transparency of data collection and processing. How these regulations impact competition is a critical question that has not been thoroughly studied. Our study applies a DID framework to examine the effect of GDPR on the mobile app market. We find that data privacy regulations can be both anti- competitive and pro-competitive. Specifically, our results show that the competition in the free app market has become more volatile after the implementation of GDPR than before. Interestingly, however, the opposite effect is found in the paid app market. Our results suggest that GDPR has significantly affected the competition in the app market. Also, the apps’ revenue models influence this impact. Our work contributes to multiple streams of the IS literature and provides meaningful insights for policymakers and firms. </span>
